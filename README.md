# LOWREZJAM | PLSMGN! (Plasmagun!)

> A top-down twin stick shooter where _I need to shoot, but can't waste ammo_ is the base mechanic.

Originally built for the **Ludum Dare 39** competition, this is the remake/demake version built exclusively for the **2017 LOWREZJAM**.

It's built around what couldn't be made into the LD version and, also, upon some of the feedback received in the competition.

It surprised be that it reached some scores I never expected to as:

- **1st** place in _audio_;
- **9th** place in _enjoyment_;
- **9th** place in _overall_;

## Requirements

To be able to run, edit and build this project, you'll need a copy of **GameMaker Studio 2**.

There are two project versions because the _HTML5_ version needs different screen size and rendering styles, since it doesn't go well with the desktop rendering/sizing style.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Structure

There are two versions of the project in this repository:

```
yx-plsmgn       --> The desktop version
yx-plsmgn-html  --> The HTML5-tweaked version
```
