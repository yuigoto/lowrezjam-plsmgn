YUITI Project License
=====================

_Version 0.0.1_

The **YX Project License** states that the contents of this project should
**NOT** be made available to the public, but that doesn't mean isn't a fully
closed project.

This license, while made to let me properly have a license for closed projects,
was also made so I could have a more controlled _open_ environment for my code,
which means:

- Not too many (or any) forks of my project, as I don't want, and don't want to
make, a mess out of my (and anyone's) code;
- Request to the repository are made on a _per request_ basis to the
[owner's e-mail address][contactmail], but once you're in, you're free to go;
- Invited users **cannot** invite other users, but can point to the owner's
e-mail so others can request access;
- Access to the code isn't guaranteed to everyone, writing a proper request
and _justifying_ your reasons to have access might help;
- Crediting is appreciated, _but credit the author's name only_, not the
repo link;
